> "Automate all the things" - Nicol√°s Bevacqua

This is an attempt to automate the process of creating ngrx/* ducks, effects, models and middlewares. These files have proven to be really boilerplatey and having a simple tool that allows me to create simple CRUD-ready files seemed important as I spent a considerable amount of time writing / copy&pasting these.

It uses the amazing Vorpal lib.

## TODO
- [x] Basic commands (`duck`, `model`, `effect`, `middleware`, `ls`, `cd`, `init`, `bundle`)
- [x] Basic structure (Duck)
- [x] Basic structure (Effects)
- [x] Basic structure (Model)
- [x] Basic structure (Middleware)
- [x] Extract config values to a file
- [x] Bundle should include model in reducer and effects
- [x] cd should change Vorpal's delimiter to the current dir
- [x] `duck`, `model`, `effect`, `middleware` and `bundle` should get a path as param, fallback to defaults
- [x] Prompt for config values
- [x] Store config .ngdux file
- [x] Lift from .ngdux config file
- [ ] `init` should be able to execute using any path
- [ ] `bundle` should work with custom path
- [ ] Default values should be stored somewhere so we can use them instead of the .ngdux ones when using `-d`
- [ ] Add tests
- [ ] Test in Win (it probably doesn't work)
